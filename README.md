Our project focuses on a security system that is designed merely to serve the purpose of providing security to women so that they never feel helpless while facing such social challenges. An advanced system can be built that can detect the location of a person that will enable us to take action
accordingly based on electronic gadgets like GSM, Accelerometer sensor.
We can make use of a number of sensors to precisely detect the real time
situation of the women in critical abusive situations. The gadgets help
make decisions along with other sensors like Accelerometer sensors to
detect the abnormal motion of the women while she is victimized. The idea
to develop a smart device for women is that itâ€™s completely comfortable
and easy to use as compared with already existing women security
solutions such as a separate garment, bulky belts and infamous mobile
apps that are just very abstract and obsolete. The Smart band integrated
with Smart phone has an added advantage so as to reduce the cost of the
device and also in reduced size.
